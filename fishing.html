			<h2>About:</h2> 
			<p> Within New England there is many different species of fish</p>
			<p> that are able to be caught. Specifically the ones I am going</p>
			<p> to focus on some specific species including large/small mouth bass,</p>
			<p> croppie, and pike. Each act and live similary. When fishing for</p>
			<p> croppie on ice it is smart to use bright colored jigs which are bait</p>
			<p> that attract them in. Large mouth and pike are different from this</p>
			<p> because they are usually attracted to live bait called minnows.</p>
			<p> My personal favoirte fish to catch is a largemouth bass this is </p>
			<p> because there are many ways to catch this fish and in gernal they</p>
			<p> fight harder because the size of them. Pike in gernal can get much</p>
			<p> bigger but where I fish in general they are not all that common.</p>
