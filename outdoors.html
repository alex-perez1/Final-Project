			<p>In the outdoors I love to do many things</p> 
			<p>One of my favorite things to do in the outdoors</p> 
			<p>is to ride four wheelers. I have been riding four</p>
			<p>wheelers since I was around 5 where my grandpa had taught me.</p>
			<p>There has been good times and some rough times, but they are</p>
			<p>always fun times.</p>
